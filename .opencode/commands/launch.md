description: Deploy the GOVA app live via Cloudflare Tunnel
---

You are running the GOVA deployment workflow. Only run this after the developer has reviewed the running app from `/build`.

---

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Read `.env` and verify:

**1. `TUNNEL_TOKEN`** — must exist and be non-empty.
If missing, STOP: "TUNNEL_TOKEN is missing from .env. Create a tunnel at dash.cloudflare.com → Zero Trust → Tunnels."

**2. `APP_ENV`** — must be `production`.
If not, update it in `.env` automatically: `APP_ENV=production`
Then tell the developer: "APP_ENV set to production. Session cookies now require HTTPS. Do not revert for a live deployment."

**3. `APP_URL`** — should be set to the public domain.
If empty, warn (non-blocking): set APP_URL for Stripe webhooks / OAuth callbacks.

---

## Step 2: Add Cloudflare Tunnel to docker-compose.yml

If `docker-compose.yml` does not have a `tunnel:` service, append under `services:`:

```yaml
  tunnel:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: ${APP_NAME}-tunnel
    command: tunnel run
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
    networks:
      - default
```

---

## Step 3: Restart Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Tunnel

```bash
docker compose logs tunnel
```
Expected: `connection registered` or `Registered tunnel connection`.

---

## Step 5: Report

> **Deployment complete.**
>
> Configure domain routing: Zero Trust → Tunnels → [your tunnel] → Public Hostname → `http://app:8080`
>
> Local access still available at: `http://localhost:[APP_PORT]`
